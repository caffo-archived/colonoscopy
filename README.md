Colonoscopy
===========

Colonoscopy is a low contrast color scheme based on my textmate theme [Havenjark](https://github.com/caffo/havenjark).

It's available for:

* Rubymine
* Sublime Text
* Textmate
* Iterm 2
* MacVim/GVim
* Propane

## Sublime
Open sublime, select Preferences, Browse Packages. Put the theme file inside the User folder.

## Rubymine
To install a it, download the xml file, copy to ~/Library/Preferences/RubyMine40/colors/ (Mac OS X) or C:\Users\%username%.RubyMine40\config\colors\ (Windows) and restart RubyMine. Then go to IDE Settings | Editor | Colors and select 'Colonoscopy'.

## Caveats

* Most of these themes uses the [PragmataPro](http://www.fsd.it/fonts/pragmatapro.htm) typeface. Make sure you have it or change the font before applying the theme.
* You don't like the typeface. I know.
* You don't like the theme. I know.
* You don't like the theme name. I know.
